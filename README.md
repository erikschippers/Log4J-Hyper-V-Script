# Log4J-Hyper-V-Script
Scan Hyper-V Windows Guests for Log4J vulnerabillities

Download the scanner for Windows from: https://github.com/logpresso/CVE-2021-44228-Scanner
Available parameters are available on the Github page mentioned above.

I've written a script to scan Hyper-V Windows Guests for the Log4J vulnerability, which collects the results and generates a CSV file as a report.

Look for: "Invoke-Command -VMName" to change the parameters if needed.
